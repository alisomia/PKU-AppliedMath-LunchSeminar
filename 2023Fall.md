    GFlowNets: Exploratory Probabilistic Inference for Scientific Discovery

    <b>摘要</b>:

    This talk will introduce and discuss generative flow networks (GFlowNets), a learning framework for amortized sampling, from a sequential decision-making perspective. Different from reinforcement learning, which optimizes trajectory-level statistics, GFlowNet targets sampling proportional to the reward function over the terminal states in a Markov decision process. A family of algorithms could thus be derived (as in RL). Fruitful connection with previous probabilistic methods and control can be drawn. We would also talk about its wide application in science in domains such as causal discovery, and drug discovery, and combinatorial optimization.

    Transformed Primal-Dual Methods for Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations

    <b>摘要</b>:

    Steady-state nonlinear partial differential equations can be understood as finding the minimum of some smooth convex energy with equality constraints. After introducing the Lagrange multiplier, we are seeking the saddle point of a nonlinear system. A transformed primal-dual (TPD) flow is developed for such a nonlinear saddle point system. The flow for the dual variable contains a Schur complement which is strongly convex. Exponential stability of the saddle point is obtained by showing the strong Lyapunov property. A TPD iteration is derived by time discretization of the TPD flow. Under mild assumption, the algorithm is global linearly convergent, and the convergence rate depends on the relative condition number of the objective function and the Schur complement under variant metric as preconditioners. The developed algorithm is then applied to partial differential equations: Darcy–Forchheimer model and a nonlinear electromagnetic model. Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of the method. This is joint work with Long Chen (UC Irvine) and Ruchi Guo (CUHK).

    <b>摘要</b>:

    Consider the steady-state Navier-Stokes system in planar exterior domains. With no-slip boundary condition and a prescribed constant limit velocity at infinity, this problem describes steady-state flows around cylindrical obstacles. An open problem since Leray (1933) asks whether solutions to this problem exist for arbitrary limit velocities. We recall the classical theory concerning the invading domain method, asymptotic behaviour of D-solutions, and purtubative analysis based on Oseen asymptotics. Then we present some recent progress. Based on joint works with M. Korobkov and J. Guillod.

    Efficient Derivative-Free Bayesian Inference for Large-Scale Inverse Problems

    <details>

    <p>
    <b>摘要</b>:

    We consider Bayesian inference for large-scale inverse problems, where computational challenges arise from the need for repeated evaluations of an expensive forward model, which is often given as a black box or is impractical to differentiate. We propose a framework, which is built on Kalman methodology and Fisher-Rao Gradient flow, to efficiently calibrate and provide uncertainty estimations of such models with noisy observation data.

    In this talk, I will first explain some basics of variational inference under general metric tensor. In particular, under the Fisher-Rao metric, the gradient flow of the KL divergence has the form of a birth-death process, which has both exponential convergence O(e^-t) and the affine invariant property. The Gaussian approximation of it leads to the natural gradient descent. 
    
    Next, I will discuss two different derivative-free approximations of the Fisher-Rao gradient flow. The Gaussian approximation leads to unscented/ensemble Kalman Inversion algorithms. They can also be obtained from a Gaussian approximation of the filtering distribution of a novel mean-field dynamical system. Theoretical guarantees for linear inverse problems are provided.
    
    The Gaussian mixture approximation leads to an efficient derivative-free Bayesian inference approach capable of capturing multiple modes. Finally, I will demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches in several numerical experiments: learning permeability parameters in subsurface flow; and learning subgrid-scale parameters in a global climate model.

    New trends for p-Laplacian eigenproblems on graphs
    <details>
    <summary>具体信息</summary>
    
    <p>
    <b>摘要</b>:

    The spectrum of the graph p-Laplacian is closely related to many combinatorial properties of the graph itself; and its eigenpairs, reveal important information about the topology and geometry of the graph. In particular, when p is equal to 1 and infinity, the p-Laplacian eigenvalues approximate the multi-way Cheeger constants and the packing radii of the graph, respectively. However, the eigenvalue problem for graph p-Laplacians is a challenging topic both theoretically and computationally. In this talk, I will present some new ingredients for studying the graph p-Laplacian eigenproblem. These include homological eigenvalues, spectral duality, and tools from signed graphs.

    Discovery and analysis of cell-fate landscape underlying single-cell transcriptome data

    <details>

    <p>
    <b>摘要</b>:

    Single-cell sequencing technologies provide unprecedented resolution for studying the dynamic process of cell-state transitions during development and complex disease. These transitions can be modeled and understood as a multi-scale, stochastic dynamical system on a cell-fate landscape. This could significantly enhance the interpretability and robustness of data mining and biological discovery. However, analyzing high-dimensional, static single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data with such models can be challenging due to the curse of dimensionality. In this talk, I will discuss how machine learning has enabled us to overcome the challenge and use dynamical system tools to analyze scRNA-seq data. I will first introduce the MuTrans algorithm, which uses a low-dimensional dynamical manifold to identify attractor basins and transition probabilities in snapshot data. I will also present the spliceJAC algorithms, which use non-equilibrium dynamical theory to analyze attractor stability within the landscape and identify transition-driving genes in gene expression and splicing processes. Finally, I will discuss our efforts to construct a time-varying landscape, which interpolates non-stationary time-series scRNA-seq data using Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao metric, unbalanced optimal transport and its neural network-based partial differential equation implementations. Overall, these approaches bridge the model-based and data-driven methods in the modeling and analysis of single-cell biology.

    On Matsubara Green’s functions in quantum many body physics: fast Feynman diagrams evaluations and robust analytic continuation

    <details>
    <summary>具体信息</summary>
    
    <p>
    <b>摘要</b>:

    SThis talk assumes no prior knowledge in physics or chemistry, but will discuss several algorithmic contributions in such fields. We will first introduce a fast deterministic solver for Anderson impurity problems. The bottleneck of this problem is to accurately evaluate n-th order Feynman diagrams. Mathematically, this corresponds to computing MANY 2n-dimensional integrals, which is computationally non trivial for n>2. Then we will discuss how to solve the analytic continuation problem in condensed matter physics, which could be seen as a very ill-posed inverse problem from an applied mathematics perspective. Finally, we will discuss some recent trends in the algorithmic development of many-body physics, focusing on Green’s function approaches and diagrammatics.

    Model-Based Derivative-Free Optimization

    <p>
    <b>摘要</b>:

    Derivative-free optimization concerns the optimization of black-box functions. It is a diverse field studied under multiple disciplines, which leads to an array of methods with fundamental distinctions. Among them, algorithms based on polynomial interpolation and trust-region methods are capable of finding solutions without the need for a large number of function queries, perfect for handling problems base on expensive computer simulations, while gradient descent methods coupled with finite differences are commonly used for solving machine learning problems such as reinforcement learning and neural adversarial attack. In this talk, Dr. Liyuan Cao presents his theoretical work on these two types of algorithms, including the analysis of approximation methods such as (randomized) finite differences and linear interpolation, and the analysis of adaptive optimization algorithms such as line search and trust-region methods under noise.

    Identifying the computational roles of local connectivity structures in Excitatory-Inhibitory networks

    <details>
    <summary>具体信息</summary>
    
    <p>
    <b>摘要</b>:

    In both neuroscience and machine learning, understanding how network connectivity shapes dynamics and computation is crucial. Past studies have approached connectivity analysis either through biological experiments, focusing on local connectivity motifs in small neuron groups, or via artificial neural networks, examining network-wide low-rank connectivity patterns influencing low-dimensional dynamics. While both approaches suggest network connectivity's influence on activity patterns and dynamics, there's a gap in understanding how local connectivity statistics relate to global connectivity and impact network dynamics. To address this, we introduce an analytical method mapping locally-defined biological connectivity statistics to an approximate global low-rank structure (Shao & Ostojic, 2023). Leveraging perturbation theory for random matrices, we approximate the global connectivity matrix using dominant eigenvectors. This method demonstrates that networks with local connectivity statistics, under the central limit theorem, can be approximated by low-rank connectivity with Gaussian-mixture statistics. Applied to excitatory-inhibitory networks, our method accurately predicts low-dimensional dynamics, the balance between excitation and inhibition, and population activity statistics. All in all, our approach allows us to disentangle the effects of mean connectivity and multiple types of second-order motifs on global recurrent feedback and feedforward propagation, providing an intuitive picture of how local connectivity shapes global network dynamics.
